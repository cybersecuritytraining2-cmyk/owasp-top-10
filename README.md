# Vault Street Bank — OWASP A01: Broken Access Control

A deliberately vulnerable online-banking application built to teach **OWASP Top 10
A01:2021 — Broken Access Control**. You will log in as an ordinary customer and
use the application's own features to access money and data that should never be
yours.

> ⚠️ **Training use only.** This app ships with intentional vulnerabilities, weak
> secrets, and seeded personal data. Never deploy it anywhere reachable from the
> internet.

## The application

**Vault Street Bank** is a small retail-banking portal. Once signed in, a
customer can:

- See their **checking balance**, **account number**, and **credit card** (number, limit, balance owed).
- View their **statement** (transaction history).
- **Transfer money** to another customer by account number.
- **Pay down their credit card** from one of their accounts.

There are three demo customers. Their credentials are shown right on the login
screen:

| Username | Password      | Account     |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `alice`  | `Spring2024!` | `5021-0001` |
| `bob`    | `Hunter2024#` | `5021-0002` |
| `carol`  | `Autumn2024$` | `5021-0003` |

## Running it

```bash
# First time — installs Ruby gems and npm packages
./install.sh

# Every time after that
./start.sh
#   Backend  → http://localhost:3000
#   Frontend → http://localhost:5173
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** and sign in. State is held in memory only — restart
the backend to reset every balance, statement, and block back to the seed data.

There is a floating **“?” Hint button** in the bottom-right of every screen if you
get stuck.

## Your objectives

This exercise is entirely about **access control** — the app authenticates you
fine, but it is sloppy about checking *what you are allowed to do* once you are in.
Sign in as **Alice** and try to achieve each of the following:

1. **Pay off your own credit card using another customer's money.**
   You should only be able to draw from *your* accounts. Can you make Bob pay
   Alice's credit-card bill?

2. **Read another customer's statement.**
   Your statement is yours alone. Can you pull up Bob's or Carol's full
   transaction history — salary, rent, spending and all?

3. **Get hold of the application's internal logs.**
   The app writes operational logs that were never meant for customers. They
   exist somewhere in the system — find a way to read them, and notice what they
   leak.

For each one, figure out **what the correct check would have been** and where it
is missing.

## How to discover the vulnerabilities

This exercise is designed to be solved four different ways. Access-control flaws
behave very differently from injection flaws under tooling — pay attention to
which methods work and which don't.

### 1. Manual testing (in the browser + an intercepting proxy)
The dashboard exposes the flaws — but not all of them are obvious by clicking:
- The **“Pay from account”** control is a **dropdown that only lists accounts you
  own**, so the UI looks safe. The ownership rule is enforced only in the browser.
  Put **Burp Suite** or **OWASP ZAP** in front of the browser, intercept the
  `POST /api/cards/pay`, and rewrite `from_account` to another customer's number
  before it reaches the server. This is the more realistic class of bug: the
  client constrains the input, the server forgets to.
- The **statement account** box is an editable text field — change it. Either way,
  inspect the requests to `/api/accounts/<n>/transactions` in your proxy. Account
  numbers are short and sequential (`5021-0001`, `5021-0002`, …) — trivial to
  enumerate.

### 2. Code review
Open `backend/app/controllers/` and read the controllers. Each intentional flaw
is marked with a `# VULNERABILITY N:` comment explaining what it is and why it is
exploitable. Compare `cards_controller.rb` (vulnerable) with
`transfers_controller.rb` (the correct pattern) — the difference *is* the bug.

### 3. SAST (Brakeman)
```bash
cd backend && bin/brakeman
```
**Brakeman reports zero warnings — and that is the lesson.** Static analysers
detect dangerous *sinks* (SQL strings, `eval`, file paths, `html_safe`). Broken
access control has no sink: the code is "safe" line-by-line and only wrong
relative to *who should be allowed to run it*. A clean SAST report does **not**
mean an app is free of A01. These bugs are found by humans and by DAST, not by
pattern-matching static analysis.

### 4. DAST / fuzzing
- **Authorization testing**: with Burp/ZAP, capture a request as Alice, then
  replay it with another account number in the path/body and watch it succeed.
- **Forced browsing / content discovery**: not every endpoint is linked from the
  UI. Fuzz the API surface for hidden paths, e.g.

  ```bash
  ffuf -u http://localhost:3000/api/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" -mc 200,403
  feroxbuster -u http://localhost:3000/api/ -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
  ```

<summary><strong>⚠️ Spoilers — full solution & walk-through (open only when you're done)</strong></summary>

### Vulnerability 1 — Pay your card from someone else's account
The UI renders the funding account as a **dropdown that only lists accounts the
signed-in customer owns** (checking + savings), so the bug isn't visible by
clicking. But `POST /api/cards/pay` reads the **funding account from the request
body** (`from_account`) and debits it without checking it belongs to the caller —
the client-side constraint is never re-enforced server-side. Intercept the
request (or just replay it with `curl`) and swap in another customer's number:

```bash
TOKEN=... # Alice's bearer token from the login response
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cards/pay \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"from_account":"5021-0002","amount":1000}'
```
Alice's card balance drops while **Bob's** balance is debited. *Fix:* force the
funding account server-side to one of `current_user`'s own accounts (reject any
`from_account` not in `current_user[:accounts]`), the same way `transfers#create`
scopes the source to `current_user`.

### Vulnerability 2 — Read anyone's statement (IDOR)
`GET /api/accounts/:account_number/transactions` looks up transactions straight
from the URL with no ownership check.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/accounts/5021-0002/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
*Fix:* reject the request unless `account_number == current_user[:account_number]`
(or the caller is staff).

### Vulnerability 3 — Read the application logs (missing function-level authz)
Here is the part that is **not mentioned anywhere else in this README on
purpose**:

There is a **hidden administrator** and an **operations console**.

- A fourth, privileged user exists — `admin` / `V@ultStr33t-0ps!2024`
  (account `5021-0000`, `role: "admin"`). It is never advertised in the customer
  UI. Real staff use it to monitor activity, **read the application logs**, and
  **block** suspicious customers.
- The console lives at the SPA route **`/admin`** (`frontend/src/views/AdminView.vue`)
  and is backed by **`/api/admin/*`** endpoints. Neither is linked from the
  navigation — but the route is sitting in the client-side bundle
  (`frontend/src/router/index.js`) and the API paths show up under content
  discovery / fuzzing.

**How a participant discovers it**
- *Client-side analysis:* read the JS bundle / Vue router and find the `/admin`
  route and the `adminLogs`/`adminTransactions`/`adminUsers` calls in
  `services/api.js`.
- *Fuzzing:* `ffuf`/`feroxbuster` against `/api/` surfaces `/api/admin/logs`,
  `/api/admin/transactions`, `/api/admin/users`.

**Why it's exploitable**
`Api::Admin::DashboardController` runs `before_action :authenticate_user!` but
**never calls `require_admin!`**. So *any logged-in customer* who reaches the
endpoints gets full access:

```bash
# As Alice — a plain customer — read the raw logs:
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/logs -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
or simply browse to **http://localhost:5173/admin** while logged in as Alice.

The logs leak a password-reset token (`prt_9f3a1c7e8b24`), internal IPs, a backup
location, and an admin API key (`vs_live_4e7b91d0c2a8`). The same broken
authorization lets a customer **block other users** via
`POST /api/admin/users/:id/block`.

*Fix:* add `before_action :require_admin!` to the admin controller (the helper
already exists in `ApplicationController` — it is simply never wired up).

### The underlying theme
All three bugs are the same mistake in three costumes: **the server authenticates
the user but trusts the client for authorization.** The correct fix is always to
derive identity/authority from the *session* (`current_user`) on the server, and
to check it on *every* sensitive action.
